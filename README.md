# Linked Data generation rules

## How the rules are written and executed
First, the rules are written using [YARRRML](https://w3id.org/yarrrml).
Next, the YARRRML rules are converted to [RML](http://rml.io) rules.
Finally, the RML rules are executed to generate the Linked Data.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome, and bug reports or pull requests are always helpful.
However, if you want to see big changes to the rules, it's best to contact us first.
